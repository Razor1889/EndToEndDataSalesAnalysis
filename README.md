# EndToEndDataSalesAnalysis
This project analyzes historical sales data from Gamezone, a fictional gaming retailer, to uncover key patterns across time, product categories, and geographic regions. The objective was to clean, transform, and model the dataset, then build interactive dashboards in Power BI that surface insights to guide strategic decision-making.
